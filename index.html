        <h2>Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          I am a self taught programmer who loves front end development and has experience with back end development. My passion is coding and seeing my code come to life. I want to learn and grow in the progamming world and become a great programmer. I will work hard and meticulously, I take my time typing to minimize bugs. I re-read my code constantly combing for bugs and typos to ensure it is readable and effiecient.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have learned the basics of several different programing languages including Python, C#, Javascript/Typescript, and Solidity. I also learned Html and Css when teaching myself Web Development. While teaching myself all these different skills I got familiar with the Django Framework as well as The React.js Framework. I love THREE.js. I am familiar with Brownie. I learned how to create and run Smart Contracts using Solidity and python.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have a good grasp of the blockchain and how it works. I am a quick learner and anything I donâ€™t know I pick-up very quickly. I am creative and quick thinking. I have excellent problem solving skills. I am independent but work well with a team. I hope to become one of your team's most valuable assets as I would love to work for and with you.
